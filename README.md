# Wi-Fi Association_Disassociation Dataset

This project aims to generate a real-time dataset for intrusion detection systems (IDS) in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) environments, with the main focus on de-authentication and disassociation attacks detection. 
This dataset is part of the main goal of our research, which aims to propose a novel IDS for de-authentication and disassociation attack detection and advance the development of IDSs in all real-world Wi-Fi network infrastructures. To accomplish this, de-authentication and disassociation attacks are executed on a Wi-Fi testbed consisting of 16 devices.

The following illustrates the main objectives of the Wi-Fi De-authentication_Disassociation dataset project:

- building new realistic testbed for de-authentication and disassociation attack datasets 
- generating normal Wi-Fi traffic data using real user devices and launching attacks using two different tools (Kali Linux and Deauther)
- building an automated process that collects, parses, visualizes and analyzes the the network traffic data built on top of Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)
- producing a structured dataset that can be used for further steps in machine/deep learning-based IDS development
- futher preprocessing this dataset and used in our IDS development called "Transfer and CNN-Based IDS for De-authentication (Disassociation) DoS Attack Detection";
We evaluate the performance of machine and deep learning algorithms using the CICIoT2023 dataset to classify and detect IoT network traffic as malicious or benign.

This Wi-Fi De-authentication_Disassociation dataset project and activities around it can be summarized in the following steps:
